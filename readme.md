Steps for installing dependencies.

tips: if you have npm and forgot commands then just do "npm help".

1. Get npm if you havent, https://github.com/npm/cli (you need node-js for this https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Make sure npm is installed, go cmd then type "npm --version", should display a version.
3. Get a powershell terminal in visual studio code, and type "npm install" to install all dependencies in this project.

## after installing dependencies

1. Inside the powershell terminal, do "npm run tsc" to compile the ts files, and then do "npm run dev" to open the vue testing server.
2. Then just click on the localhost or type "o" in the node terminal to open up a window.
3. To terminate the vite server just do ctrl + c then type y after the terminate batch job prompt in the node terminal where you first ran "npm run dev".
