Steps for installing dependencies.

tips: if you have npm and forgot commands then just do "npm help".

1. Get npm if you havent, https://github.com/npm/cli (you need node-js for this https://nodejs.org/en)
2. make sure npm is installed, go cmd -> "npm --version", should display xx.x.x (10.8.3 for example).
3. get a powershell terminal in visual studio code, and type "npm install" to install all dependencies in this project.
